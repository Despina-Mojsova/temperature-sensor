This project is a PCB design for a temperature sensor, developed in KiCad. It employs a thermistor to measure temperature, processes the signal, and provides LED indication for visual feedback.  

Components
- TH1 - Thermistor  
- U1 - Integrated circuit  
- T1, T2 - Transistors  
- R1-R5 - Resistors  
- C1 - Capacitor  
- D1 - Diode  
- LED1 - Indicator  
- CON1 - Connector  
- Power1 - Power input  

 Design  
The project includes:  
- Schematic design** in KiCad  
- PCB layout optimized for compactness and functionality  

Files  
- `sensor_schematic.kicad_sch` - Schematic  
- `sensor_pcb.kicad_pcb` - PCB layout  

Installation & Usage  
1. Open the files in KiCad.  
2. Generate Gerber files for PCB manufacturing.  
3. Assemble components onto the PCB.  
4. Test the sensor under various temperatures.
